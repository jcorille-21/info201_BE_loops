# Create a variable called "total_ten_loops" that sums up every value in a for
# loop that runs for ten times. What would "total_ten_loops" become as a result?



# Make a for loop that runs for 13 times. On every odd occurrence of the loop,
# the loop prints out "Odds!" On every even occurrence of the loop, the loop
# prints out "Evens!"
# Hint: is there a specific operator that could be used to check if a number is
# even or odd?



# Make a for loop that creates a "staircase" of letters. The letters can be
# anything, just as long as it looks like stairs one can climb!
# Here is an example of a staircase of letters:
# a
# aa
# aaa
# aaaa
# aaaaa
# Hint: would you need more than one loop to create the staircase?
# Hint2: how would you create a new line?
# Hint3: you might need to use sep once or twice :)
