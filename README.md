# INFO 201 BE Loops Practice

The purpose of this assignment is to get practice on cloning and loops!
Note that you **don't** have to push anything. That would cause a lot of
merging issues! You won't have to worry about merging til later on.
Here's what you need to do instead:

- `git clone` this repository onto your machine
- Work with a partner or two (or even more!) on the problems
- Check in with me if you need help!

More specific coding instructions are available on the `loop_practice.R` file.
